Installation instructions for AboveInfinity


AboveInfinity is a header-only library, which means that there's nothing to be compiled before one can use it.
Moreover, these header files are platform independent.

There are two ways of using this library:

First method: Installing without using CMake

The headers found in the include/ subdirectory can be used straight away.
To install them, just copy the include/subdirectory to the desired location.

Second method: Installing using CMake

Let's call the directory containing this file the "source_dir".
Before starting, create another directory (i.e. "build").

Run:
cd build
cmake source_dir
run make install

Note that the "make install" step might require administrator privileges.

Also note that one can adjust the installation destination (the "prefix")
by passing the -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=prefix option to cmake
